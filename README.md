# cryptopals
Solutions for the [Matasano Crypto Challenges](http://cryptopals.com).

## usage
Run by executing main.py. The default is to run all sets. If you wish to run only a certain set, pass the set number as a command line param, (e.g. main.py 2 to run set 2). Solutions are work in progress, I try to do the challenges sequentially but jump ahead every now and then.
A note on Set 4: To run set 4 (specifically the last two challenges) you need to be running the server code in parallel. The easiest way to do this is to just open up another terminal and run python server.py before running the set.
