# cryptopals
Solutions for the [Matasano Crypto Challenges](http://cryptopals.com).

## usage
Run by executing main.py. The default is to run all sets. If you wish to run only a certain set, pass the set number as a command line param, (e.g. main.py 2 to run set 2). Solutions are work in progress, I try to do the challenges sequentially but jump ahead every now and then.
